Changes in spcosa 0.2-0 (2009-11-11)
    o   added a line (at start-up and in the package-file) that a
        recent version of Java is required in order to run spcosa.
    o   upgraded to R 2.10-0 and rJava 0.8-1. Previous releases of
        spcosa are not compatible with the new rJava 0.8-series

Changes in spcosa 0.1-5 (2009-09-08)
    o   fixed 'suspect' hyperlink issue reported by 'R CMD check' of
        'R version 2.10.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-09-07 r49613)'
    o   added more contrast to spatial strata plots

Changes in spcosa 0.1-4 (2009-06-29)
    o   minor bug fixed in method "getArea". In previous versions of spcosa,
        the area was returned in units of grid cells i.s.o. map units.
        Since spcosa relies on relative areas, this bug did _not_ affect
        other methods in the package.
    o   visualization of class hierarchies in the package vignette by means
        of the new 'classesToAM' function
    o   minor update of documentation (Rd files)
    o   warnings due to coercion to class SpatialPixelsDataFrame have been
        suppressed.
    o   dependency has been increased from  R (>= 2.8.0) to R (>= 2.9.0).
        Otherwise ggplot2-functions might fail.

Changes in spcosa 0.1-3 (2009-05-16)
    o   citation file has been updated
    o   minor improvements of source code

Changes in spcosa 0.1-2 (2009-03-23)
    o   fixed a minor bug in the plot method with signature
        "SamplingPatternPriorPoints"
    o   minor update of package vignette

Changes in spcosa 0.1-1 (2009-03-13)
    o   documentation has been made compatible with "R version 2.9.0 Under
        development (unstable) (2009-03-08 r48082)"

Changes in spcosa 0.1-0 (2009-03-12)
