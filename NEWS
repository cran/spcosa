Changes in spcosa 0.1-5 (2009-09-08)
    o   fixed 'suspect' hyperlink issue reported by 'R CMD check' of
        'R version 2.10.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-09-07 r49613)'
    o   added more contrast to spatial strata plots

Changes in spcosa 0.1-4 (2009-06-29)
    o   minor bug fixed in method "getArea". In previous versions of spcosa,
        the area was returned in units of grid cells i.s.o. map units.
        Since spcosa relies on relative areas, this bug did _not_ affect
        other methods in the package.
    o   visualization of class hierarchies in the package vignette by means
        of the new 'classesToAM' function
    o   minor update of documentation (Rd files)
    o   warnings due to coercion to class SpatialPixelsDataFrame have been
        suppressed.
    o   dependency has been increased from  R (>= 2.8.0) to R (>= 2.9.0).
        Otherwise ggplot2-functions might fail.

Changes in spcosa 0.1-3 (2009-05-16)

    o   minor improvements of source code

Changes in spcosa 0.1-2 (2009-03-23)
    o   fixed a minor bug in the plot method with signature
